# Task Execution Service (TES)

Provides a standard mechanism for orchestrating complex analyses across
different compute environments

Analyzing data across the world can make genomics research more powerful by
connecting many large-scale datasets for simultaneous analysis. Such
investigations use complex methods, like aligning multiple sequences to the
human reference genome to identify potentially pathogenic variants. These
analyses often involve up to hundreds of thousands of computational tasks, which
can take considerable time and compute power to execute. Developed by the [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)
Cloud Work Stream, the [Task Execution Service (TES)](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas)
provides a standard mechanism for orchestrating these complex analyses across
different compute environments.
